      <p>Students with better academic achievements in high school are more likely to get accepted to prestigious universities. This is because such universities usually look for students with high SAT scores or equivalent in their admission process. Colleges usually require applicants from the best high schools to have a minimum of 1300 on the SATs and have a GPA of 3.5, its equivalent or higher. Hence, it is important for students who want to get into a prestigious university to earn good grades in high school.

        Moreover, students should work towards good grades because they are paramount for their future success. They will get better jobs and earn more money in the long run if they tend to excel academically.

In this essay, we shall explore the definition of academic achievements, importance and other implications of the same.</p>
